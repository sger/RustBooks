### [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) *Free*

Welcome! This book will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’ even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language. Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.

### [Welcome to Rust-101](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html) *Free*

This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.
If you have any questions that are not answered here, check out the "Additional Resources" below. In particular, the IRC channel is filled with awesome people willing to help you! I spent lots of time there ;-)
I will assume some familiarity with programming, and hence not explain the basic concepts common to most languages. Instead, I will focus on what makes Rust special.

### [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/) *Free*

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget to [install Rust locally](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) and check out the [official docs](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example).

### [Why Rust?](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/why-rust.csp)

While systems programming languages have greatly evolved since the introduction of C more than 40 years ago, our capacity for dumb mistakes with enormous consequences has remained unchanged, with vivid examples regularly in the news. This O'Reilly report examines Rust, a new systems programming language that combines safety and security with performance on a par with C and C++.

### [Learning Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-rust)

<img src="https://d255esdrn735hr.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/5114.jpg" width="120px"/>

Rust is a highly concurrent and high performance language that focuses on safety and speed, memory management, and writing clean code. It also guarantees thread safety, and its aim is to improve the performance of existing applications. It has been backed by Mozilla to solve the critical problem of concurrency.

###[Rust Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rust-cookbook) 

<img src="https://d1ldz4te4covpm.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/9781785880254.png" width="120px"/>

This book will help you understand the core concepts of the Rust language, enabling you to develop efficient and high-performance applications by incorporating features such as zero cost abstraction and better memory management.Delve into advanced-level concepts such as error handling, macros, crates, and parallelism in Rust. Toward the end of the book, learn how to create HTTP servers and web services, building a strong foundational knowledge in server-side programming and enabling to deliver solutions to build high-performance and safer production-level web applications and services using Rust.

###[Rust Essentials - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rust-essentials-second-edition) 

<img src="https://d1ldz4te4covpm.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/B08304%20_cover.png" width="120px"/>

This book starts off with an argumentation of Rust's unique place in today's landscape of programming languages. Install Rust and learn how to work with its package manager Cargo. The various concepts are introduced step by step: variables, types, functions, and control structures to lay the groundwork. Then explore more structured data such as strings, arrays, and enums, and see how pattern matching works. Throughout all this, this book lays emphasis on the unique ways of reasoning that the Rust compiler uses to produce safe code. Next look at Rust's specific way of error handling, and the overall importance of traits in Rust code. The pillar of memory safety is treated in depth as we explore the various pointer kinds. Next, see how macros can simplify code generation, and how to compose bigger projects with modules and crates. Finally, discover how we can write safe concurrent code in Rust and interface with C programs, get a view of the Rust ecosystem, and explore the use of the standard library.

### [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/)

This book digs into all the awful details that are necessary to understand in order to write correct Unsafe Rust programs. Due to the nature of this problem, it may lead to unleashing untold horrors that shatter your psyche into a billion infinitesimal fragments of despair.

Should you wish a long and happy career of writing Rust programs, you should turn back now and forget you ever saw this book. It is not necessary. However if you intend to write unsafe code -- or just want to dig into the guts of the language -- this book contains invaluable information.

### [Rust Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rust-essentials)

<img src="https://dz13w8afd47il.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/5769OS_Rust%20Essentials.jpg" width="120px"/>

Starting by comparing Rust with other programming languages, this book will show you where and how to use Rust. It will discuss primitive types along with variables and their scope, binding and casting, simple functions, and ways to control execution flow in a program.

Next, the book covers flexible arrays, vectors, tuples, enums, and structs. You will then generalize the code with higher-order functions and generics applying it to closures, iterators, consumers, and so on. Memory safety is ensured by the compiler by using references, pointers, boxes, reference counting, and atomic reference counting. You will learn how to build macros and crates and discover concurrency for multicore execution.

By the end of this book, you will have successfully migrated to using Rust and will be able to use it as your main programming language.

### [Programming Rust](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do)

If concurrent programs are giving you sleepless nights, Rust is your go-to language. Filled with real-world examples and explanations, this book will show you how you can build scalable and reliable programs for your organization.

We’ll teach you big level concepts that make Rust a great language. Improving performance, using generics, building macros, and working with threads are just some of the topics we’ll cover. We’ll talk about the official toolsets and ways to discover more. The book contains a mix of theory interspersed with hands-on tasks so you acquire the skills as well as the knowledge. Since programming cannot be learned by just reading, we provide exercises (and solutions) to hammer the concepts in.

### [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.nostarch.com/Rust)

<img src="https://www.nostarch.com/sites/default/files/styles/uc_product/public/RustProgrammingLanguage_cover_0.png" width="120px"/>

The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust; a community-developed, systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Rust’s memory safety guarantees, enforced at compile time, safeguard your programs against the many problems that pervade other systems languages. Rust offers the control and performance of a low-level language with the helpful abstractions of a high level one, and does this all without having a garbage collector. These characteristics make Rust useful for embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems.
