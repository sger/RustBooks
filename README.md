### [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) *Free*

Welcome! This book will teach you about the Rust programming language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for several use cases other languages aren’t good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having several compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead while eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’ even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language. Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.

### [Welcome to Rust-101](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html) *Free*

This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.
If you have any questions that are not answered here, check out the "Additional Resources" below. In particular, the IRC channel is filled with awesome people willing to help you! I spent lots of time there ;-)
I will assume some familiarity with programming, and hence not explain the basic concepts common to most languages. Instead, I will focus on what makes Rust special.

### [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) *Free*

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget to [install Rust locally](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and check out the [official docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example).

### [Easy Rust](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/) *Free*

Rust is a new language that already has good textbooks. But sometimes its textbooks are difficult because they are for native English speakers. Many companies and people now learn Rust, and they could learn faster with a book that has easy English. This textbook is for these companies and people to learn Rust with simple English.

### [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/)  *Free*

I fairly frequently get asked how to implement a linked list in Rust. The answer honestly depends on what your requirements are, and it's obviously not super easy to answer the question on the spot. As such I've decided to write this book to comprehensively answer the question once and for all.
In this series I will teach you basic and advanced Rust programming entirely by having you implement 6 linked lists. In doing so, you should learn:
- The following pointer types: &, &mut, Box, Rc, Arc, *const, *mut, NonNull(?)
- Ownership, borrowing, inherited mutability, interior mutability, Copy
- All The Keywords: struct, enum, fn, pub, impl, use, ...
- Pattern matching, generics, destructors
- Testing, installing new toolchains, using miri
- Unsafe Rust: raw pointers, aliasing, stacked borrows, UnsafeCell, variance

### [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/) *Free*

<img src="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/PPrustS.png" width="120px"/>

Rust is a statically and strongly typed systems programming language. statically means that all types are known at compile-time, strongly means that these types are designed to make it harder to write incorrect programs. A successful compilation means you have a much better guarantee of correctness than with a cowboy language like C. systems means generating the best possible machine code with full control of memory use. So the uses are pretty hardcore: operating systems, device drivers and embedded systems that might not even have an operating system. However, it's a very pleasant language to write normal application code in as well.

The big difference from C and C++ is that Rust is safe by default; all memory accesses are checked. It is not possible to corrupt memory by accident.

WebAssembly is more than just a revolutionary new technology. It’s reshaping how we build applications for the web and beyond. Where technologies like ActiveX and Flash have failed, you can now write code in whatever language you prefer and compile to WebAssembly for fast, type-safe code that runs in the browser, on mobile devices, embedded devices, and more. Combining WebAssembly’s portable, high-performance modules with Rust’s safety and power is a perfect development combination.

Learn how WebAssembly’s stack machine architecture works, install low-level wasm tools and discover the dark art of writing raw wast code. Build on that foundation and learn how to compile WebAssembly modules from Rust by implementing the logic for a checkers game. Create wasm modules in Rust to interoperate with JavaScript in many compelling ways. Apply your new skills to the world of non-web hosts, and create everything from an app running on a Raspberry Pi that controls a lighting system, to a fully-functioning online multiplayer game engine where developers upload their own arena-bound WebAssembly combat modules.

<img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789342758/cover/smaller" width="120px"/>

Microservice architecture is sweeping the world as the de facto pattern to build web-based applications. Rust is a language particularly well suited to building microservices. It is a new system programming language that offers a practical and safe alternative to C.

This book describes web development using the Rust programming language and will get you up and running with modern web frameworks and crates with examples of RESTful microservices creation. You will deep dive into Reactive programming, asynchronous programming and split our web application into a set of concurrent actors. The book provides several highly accurate HTTP-handling examples with manageable memory allocations. You will be walked through stateless high-performance microservices which are ideally suitable for computation or caching tasks and get to stateful microservices which are filled with persistent data and database interactions. As we move along, you will learn to use Rust macros to describe business or protocol entities of our application and compile them into native structs which will be performed at full speed with the help of the server's CPU.

Finally, you will be taken through examples of how to test and debug microservices and pack them to a tiny monolithic binary or put it into a container and deploy it to modern cloud platforms such as AWS.
